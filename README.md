# python-challenge
Getting started on this assignment was tricky. Reading the budget csv file into python proved to be challenging. My first attempts were through using the os.path.join method, and were unsuccessful. 
Before contacting AskBCS for assistance, I decided to attempt to write the steps for the rest of the challenge.
This took some time, but setting up the formulas for PyBank was a straightforward tanks. 
I utilized Stack Overflow for tips on calculating average change in revenue and for helpful tricks on formatting the print and file.writing portion of this challege in order to reduce the number of lines used in python.
At this point, I was still having issues with reading the CSV file into python and spent 2.5 hours with a couple of reps at AskBCS (a supervisor included).
We eventually were able to resolve this using a somewhat modified absolute path method for PyBank.
Instructor B. Parker was very helpful during office hours as well. 

The PyPoll challenge flowed much quicker after using a similar template to PyBank.
It took me roughly 25 hours to complete this assignment.
